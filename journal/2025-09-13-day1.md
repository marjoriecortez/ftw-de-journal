# Journal — 2025-09-13 — DAY 1: SQL & ETL Basics

## 1) What I learned

- I learned how to use DBeaver and Metabase
- DE is easy learn but hard to master, Data is scalable
- Data Engineering - moving data, building foundations for data, to make other Data roles job easier
- Who needs DEs? companies with strong IT implementations
- Architect - planning, Engineering - building, Science - causality, Business - strategies
- Clickhouse - example of database, it is meant to store data, popular > RDBMS
- compression is important in DE, compression (look for similarity)

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)

- OLAP — transactional, row-oriented db, fast
- OLTP - analytical, column-oriented db, slow
- Transform(ETL vs ELT) - you make changes to the data

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)

- Building trust starts with getting data in. Even if the pipeline is simple, the discipline is about repeatability and traceability.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)

- For an example exercise in using dbt, I was having problem cleaning the raw data as there were still null values left, so I was taught how to navigate in dbt and made changes in the sql code to the clean the data. Also, to check for null values in horsepower, I used this code: SELECT COUNT(\*) FROM clean.autompg\_\_cars WHERE horsepower IS NULL, to check if there were still null values left from the cleaned data.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)

- When should you use dlt?
- How do DEs ensure that the data is clean? especially for big amounts of data
- When should you use dbt in business? What do other DEsdo without dbt?

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)

- [ ] research and read more about Data Engineering Lifecycle
- [ ] study OLAP vs OLTP

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)

I'm surprised at how cool dbeaver is! This is the first time I have ever encountered and used dbeaver and I find it very useful in querying, viewing diagrams of the data, etc. Also, Metabase was something I did not expect, I think it is helpful to see how the table you made can be visualized into different charts to see the work you've done from the raw data.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
